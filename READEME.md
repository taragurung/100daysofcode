## 100 Days of CODE 

This is the documentations of whatever have been throgh 100 days of code. In the initial days I will be following the official documentations and as we become familiar with django will implement a REST API. Which will be the first Goal.

#### Day1:
* Installed python and django using pip installer in virtualenv 
* Setup a python project using django-admin

#### Day 2:
It will be more about installing or starting the apps in the project that was created in DAY1. We will be starting will simple POLL app which is also available in the official documentations. Later we will be creating our own. This is just for understanding differnet files and their use in django.
